Ross Miller, an expert at predictive simulations of human movement, has created
a SimTK project to share his work using Moco:
[https://simtk.org/projects/umocod](https://simtk.org/projects/umocod). If
you're hoping to get a jump start with Moco, I encourage you to visit his
project.

We love when users share their progress with the Moco team and make their work
available. Thank you, Ross!

Here is a description of the project by Ross Miller:

The model is designed for optimal control simulations of general
musculoskeletal motion and walking specifically.  The main differences from
Moco's 2D walking example include tendon compliance in all muscles, a
two-segment foot, a patella with kinematic constraints, tracking of human
experimental kinematic and ground reaction force data, and simulation of a full
stride.  A solution to a MocoTrack problem with the model is included and would
serve as a good initial guess to predictive simulations.  The long-term goal of
the project is predictive simulations of muscle strengthening and prosthesis
parameter optimization after lower limb loss.  The project is a collaboration
with Dr. Elizabeth Russell Esposito at the Seattle VA and is funded by the Army
Advanced medical Technology Initiative and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation.
